              üöÄ My Journey
            </h3>
            <p>
              <span className="font-bold">Early Love for Science & Math:</span> I
              completed my basic and junior high school education at Cejose Wisdom
              International School, where I first discovered my love for science
              and mathematics. Solving problems, experimenting, and understanding
              how things worked quickly became my favorite part of school.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-bold">The Science Dream:</span> I went on to
              study General Science at Chemu Senior High Technical School, where I
              joined the National Science & Math Quiz team and proudly represented
              my school in 2023. At this point, I dreamed of going to medical
              school ‚Äî but life had other plans.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="font-bold">Choosing a New Path:</span> When I
              entered the University of Ghana in 2023, I made the bold decision to
              study Computer Science instead. At first, it felt like a leap into
              the unknown, but it quickly became one of the best decisions I‚Äôve
              ever made.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2024, I wrote my first line of code and began my developer
              journey. It was like unlocking a new superpower ‚Äî the ability to turn
              ideas into tools and solutions that others could use.

              From Curiosity to Projects
            </h3>
            <p>
              I started small, building Python scripts to automate repetitive
              tasks, then moved on to full-stack web development with React and
              Django, and eventually started working on AI/ML projects. Each
              project was an opportunity to learn, experiment, and see how far I
              could push myself.

            </h3>
            <p>
              In mid-2025, I became Scrum Master of the Solution Space Dev Team,
              where I led the development of a Car Brokerage MVP for EDBLINKX
              Company Ltd. We implemented Agile sprints, CI/CD pipelines, and
              delivered the first version of the product ahead of schedule.

              üå± My Philosophy
            </h3>
            <p>
              I believe technology is a tool for empowerment. Every project I work
              on is focused on solving real problems ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs automating
              tedious work, building tools for businesses, or helping teams work
              more efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also believe in continuous growth. I‚Äôm always learning ‚Äî through
              hackathons, study jams (like GDG Accra‚Äôs AI/ML sessions), and by
              experimenting with new technologies.
